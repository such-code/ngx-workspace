Validation module

Provides full functionality for template defined forms. Removes necessity of defining form controls in code at all. It is still possible to define custom per component validators for fields.
Features:
- define reusable rules by named contexts;
- add validation rules on the fly on server requests;
- support for generic form context errors;
- disables form on server request;
